In today's digital age, the banking industry is continuously evolving, and efficient management systems are essential. Developing a bank management system project gave us the opportunity to contribute to this dynamic sector and gain practical experience.<br>

Creating a bank management system involves addressing real-world challenges faced by banks, such as security, data management, and customer service. By working on this project, we were able to experience the functioning of banks in various aspects.

<br>This is a project which demonstrates the working of a bank on a very basic level for a people to understand. When a person enters the bank, they are presented with a welcome screen that prompts them either register as a new user or login as an existing user. After registration / login, we present to the user various features of the bank such as Loans, Fixed Deposits (FD) and Insurance.
If the user opts for any of our services, then they will be presented the service-specific options. Additionally, there is an option to exit the bank if the user wishes to leave by choosing the exit option.
